Accurate forecasting of biodiversity responses to environmental changes is critical for designing effective conservation strategies, but current state-of-the-art deep learning approaches cannot extrapolate because they do not incorporate fundamental ecological processes. This oversight is problematic because these processes are crucial in determining biodiversity’s response to environmental changes. Species occurrence data from citizen science provides unique insights into these transient responses, but require innovative methods for their effective utilization in models. Building models based on ecological first principles could be envisioned through scientific machine learning approaches. These methods allow assembling interpretable data-driven components by fusing domain knowledge and ML.
This review seeks to highlight the potential of scientific machine learning to improve species distribution models with the aim of providing more reliable forecasts of species range shifts and transient responses to global change.

\section{Introduction}

\noindent\textbf{Motivation.}
The current biodiversity crisis poses significant threats to humanity by negatively impacting ecosystem services \cite{Barnosky2011,ipbes2019}. Climate change and habitat degradations are major drivers of biodiversity loss, influencing species abundance, community composition, and spatial distribution \cite{ipbes2019, pereira2010}. Some species adapt to climate change by shifting their geographic range to track suitable environmental conditions \cite{bellard2012} when sufficient habitat connectivity supports colonization and survival \cite{hodgson2016}. However, anthropogenic pressures and land-use changes often result in habitat fragmentation, impeding species' ability to track environmental shifts effectively \cite{mcguire2016}. Realistic biodiversity forecasts are essential for guiding conservation actions that promote ecosystem resilience \cite{urban2015}. 

\noindent\textbf{What is species distribution modelling?}
Biodiversity forecasts typically rely on species distribution models (SDMs) that assume species are in equilibrium with their environment \cite{guisan2000}. These models typically overlook dynamical processes determining species’ range shifts and responses to environmental change, such as dispersal and demographic changes \cite{svenning2013}. Alternative models explicitly representing these processes, known as process-based models, are entailed with large inaccuracies, leading to imprecise forecasts in practice. Consequently, there is an urgent need to incorporate data-driven ecological dynamics into biodiversity models \cite{urban2015}. 

\noindent\textbf{What are current challenges?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Often only a function of abiotic environmental variables is considered.  
    \item Deep learning models are bad at extrapolation, such as to new regions or under climate change.
    \item Interpretability, no way of verifying if the learned functions make biophysical/ecological sense.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{How could we move forward?}
\begin{itemize}
\item How to deal with the effect of other ecological processes (biotic interactions, dispersal history, evolutionary processes, meta-community dynamics etc.)?
\item Can we use existing knowledge to constrain a deep SDM in order to improve extrapolation? For instance, species-trait-environment knowledge could be used to build a concept bottleneck~\cite{koh2020concept}. 
\item Can this encoded knowledge allow assessing the plausibility of the data-driven relations learned by the model?
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{What is scientific machine learning?}
Scientific machine learning** (SciML) is an emerging discipline within the data science community.  SciML seeks to address domain-specic data challenges and extract insights from scientific data sets through innovative methodological solutions \cite{rackauckas2020}. SciML draws on tools from both machine learning and scientific computing to develop new methods for scalable, domain-aware, robust, reliable, and interpretable learning and data analysis, and will be critical in driving the next wave of data-driven scientific discovery in the physical and engineering sciences. 

\noindent\textbf{What is the goal of this paper?} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explore opportunities offered by scientific ML approaches that could help deep SDMs have better extrapolation behaviour by leveraging biophysical/ecological knowledge.
    \item Explore types of knowledge that is, or could potentially be, available and useful for this.
    \item Identify use cases that could be used to benchmark extrapolation capacity and interpretability.
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature review on start-of-the-art species distribution models}

\subsection{Data-driven species distribution models}
\noindent\textbf{Classical SDMs}
 establish statistical relationships between species occurrence or abundance and environmental covariates, under the assumption that species–environment relationships are in equilibrium and that key environmental drivers are accurately measured and unbiased. 

Initially developed as environmental envelope models that delineated suitable conditions based on species’ known occurrences, Species distribution models (SDMs) have since evolved into statistically grounded tools that model species–environment relationships using presence, absence, or abundance data. 

Statistically, a species distribution modeling can be treated as a logistic regression or a binary classification problem and implemented via a variety of statistical and machine learning methods \cite{guisan2017habitat}, including: regression based approaches (e.g. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) \cite{nelder1972generalized}, Generalized Additive Models (GAM) \cite{hastie1986generalized}, Multivariate Adaptive Regression
Splines (MARS) \cite{friedman1991multivariate}), machine learning and classification methods (Support Vector
Machines (SVM) \cite{hearst1998support}, Artificial Neural Networks (NN) \cite{lecun2015deep}, Classification
and Regression Trees (CART) \cite{breiman2017classification}, boosting (e.g Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) \cite{elith2008working}) and bagging approaches (e.g Random Forests (RF) \cite{breiman2001random}), Maximum ENTropy \cite{phillips2017opening} in addition to ensemble models \cite{thuiller2009biomod}. 

User-friendly software packages (e.g., biomod2 \cite{thuiller2009biomod}, dismo \cite{hijmans2017package}, ENMtools \cite{warren2010enmtools}) have greatly expanded accessibility of SDMs in ecological research. Furthermore, the community has moved toward increased standardization with the proposal of standardized protocols for model building, evaluation \cite{roberts2017cross,valavi2018blockcv} and reporting \cite{fitzpatrick2021odmap,zurell2020standard}. 

%% maybe add a few words on presence/only questions and incorporating observation processes with occupancy models ??

\noindent\textbf{Joint SDMs}
Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDMs) \cite{pollock2014understanding} represent an extension of SDMs that allow for the simultaneous modeling of multiple species’ distributions. These models account not only for species–environment relationships but also for residual correlations that may reflect biotic associations.

Recent advances in JSDMs have driven the development of various statistical frameworks and computational tools. Initial implementations were grounded in Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) \cite{pollock2014understanding,ovaskainen2020joint,warton2015so}, where fixed effects represent species’ responses to environmental covariates, and random effects capture residual interspecific correlations. The primary methodological differences among JSDMs can be attributed to three main modeling choices \cite{wilkinson2019comparison}: (1) the use of hierarchical structures for regression coefficients, (2) the modeling of residual covariance either directly or through latent variables, and (3) the application of dimension reduction techniques.

In practice, the marginal predictions of JSDMs are often no better than those from single GLMs \cite{poggiato2021interpretations} and are typically outperformed by machine learning methods \cite{norberg2019comprehensive}. However, their main advantage lies in conditional predictions, i-e estimating the presence of one species given others \cite{wilkinson2021defining}. Finally, JSDMs do not directly model species interactions; estimated associations may instead reflect missing environmental variables rather than true biotic interactions \cite{blanchet2020co}.

\noindent\textbf{Deep SDMs}

Recent advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning, have enabled improvements in biodiversity forecasts through the development of deep learning-based SDMs (deep SDMs). These models can leverage large-scale opportunistic datasets, high-resolution satellite imagery, and species interaction data to enhance predictive performance \cite{brun2024, cole2023, Deneu2021, zbinden2024on}. 
By leveraging citizen science and remote sensing, which provide critical information at fine temporal scales, deep SDMs have also been used to predict ecological community composition \cite{gillespie2024,dollinger2024,hu2025introduction}.
% 
Yet these temporally resolved forecast based on deep SDM still suffer from the same limitations as those from traditional SDMs: they assume species are in equilibrium with their environments, neglecting transient dynamics. The models implicitly treat changes as instantaneous, which overlooks important ecological processes such as population growth, dispersal, and delayed responses to environmental changes \cite{isaac2014, zurell}. This equilibrium assumption fails to capture the time-lagged nature of species range shifts and their transient responses to disturbances \cite{barber-omalley2022}. Furthermore, given the high-dimensional input predictors they can handle and the complex relationships they can capture, deepSDM are even more prone to capturing correlations between species populations and the environment which are not transferable to different contexts (e.g. distant areas, future scenarios).

\subsection{Process-based species distribution models}
Process-based models are models that explicitly represent processes such as demographic processes and dispersal \cite{cantrell2004, bonneau2016}. These models embed strong ecological priors, which theoretically make them more data-efficient and capable of extrapolating beyond observed data \cite{cabral2017, briscoe2019}. However, process-based models are often difficult to calibrate and are entailed with inaccuracies in the representation of dynamical processes, leading to imprecise forecasts in practice \cite{evans2016a, connolly2017, Scheiter2013, boussange2024}.


\section{Existing scientific machine learning approaches in related fields}

\subsection{Hard constraints}
By-design
\begin{itemize}
    \item Universal differential equations, data-driven parametrization of differential equation-based models
    \item Using causal DAGs to constraint dependencies between variables for instance via structural equation models \cite{da2024towards}, known ecological interactions \cite{poggiato2025integrating}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Soft constraints}
Penalizing downstream the data-driven model for violating constraints.

"Physics-informed neural networks" (PINNs) are collocation methods relying on a neural network trained to predict an empirical dataset while respecting additional constraints provided by a process-based model \cite{Raissi2019, Kashinath2021,daw2021,bezenac2018}. PINNs and related paradigms, more generally coined "scientific machine learning" \cite{Rackauckas2020}, improve model generalization and data efficiency \cite{Raissi2019, Rackauckas2020}, and have been successfully applied to a variety of system with complex spatio-temporal dynamics, such as climate and weather predictions \cite{Kashinath2021, lam2023, kochkov2024}. PINNs have been extended successfully in the domain of systems biology \cite{lagergren2020, Yazdani2020}, where in contrast to the climate and weather field, process-based models are inaccurate. Despite these successes, scientific machine learning is only starting to be used in the context of biodiversity modeling \cite{boussange2024}.
